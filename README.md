# google-image-ripper
Scripts to download direct image links from Google Image searches.  Based on [Robert McCurdy](https://www.rmccurdy.com/)'s original [shell script](https://www.rmccurdy.com/gal/femalecelebs/gal).  The gir files are the original, simple versions.  The g2 files are versions with getopts or getopts-like flags, at least as far as the particular programming language allows, and with some arguments inspired [by this page](https://stenevang.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/google-advanced-power-search-url-request-parameters/) and [that page](https://serpapi.com/search-api).  Finally, the few g3 ones are the original gir versions modified to use XML/HTML parser libraries, e.g. BeautifulSoup or Nokogiri, instead of regex-ing everything.  Also, a few files are to be compiled, rather than being scripts.  And admittedly this probably is not really a ripper, but with a few modifications, it could download the images from the links, rather than compiling the links.  As of January 2020 or so it does not work.  The 'f.txt' file doesn not show up and manual scraping seems out too.
