# google-image-ripper
Scripts to download direct image links from Google Image searches.  Based on [Robert McCurdy](https://www.rmccurdy.com/)'s original [shell script](https://www.rmccurdy.com/gal/femalecelebs/gal).  The gir files are the original, simple versions, while the g2 files are versions with getopts or getopts-like flags, at least as far as the particular programming language allows, and with some arguments inspired [by this page](https://stenevang.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/google-advanced-power-search-url-request-parameters/).  Also, a few files are to be compiled, rather than being scripts.  And admittedly this probably is not really a ripper, but with a few modifications, it could download the images from the links, rather than compiling the links.
