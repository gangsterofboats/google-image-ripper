# google-image-ripper
Scripts to download direct image links from Google Image searches.  Based on [Robert McCurdy](https://www.rmccurdy.com/)'s original [shell script](https://www.rmccurdy.com/gal/femalecelebs/gal).  The gir files are the original, simple versions, while the g2 files are versions with getopts or getopts-like flags, at least as far as the particular programming language allows.
